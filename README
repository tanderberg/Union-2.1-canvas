This is a simple visualization of the positions of 587 SNe Ia in the Union 2.1 survey,

http://supernova.lbl.gov/Union/

It uses the HTML5 canvas element and three.js,

http://mrdoob.github.com/three.js/

and should run in recent versions of Chrome, Firefox, Opera and Internet Explorer 
(9 and up).

It was born as a test of three.js and is now doing dual duty as a test of GitHub.
